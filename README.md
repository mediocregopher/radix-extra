radix-extra
===========

Extra functionality built around the [radix][radix] redis client. Here's the api
links to available sub-packages:

* [pool](http://godoc.org/github.com/mediocregopher/radix-extra/pool) - a
  simple, automatically expanding/cleaning connection pool.

* [pubsub](http://godoc.org/github.com/mediocregopher/radix-extra/pubsub) - a
  simple wrapper providing convenient access to Redis Pub/Sub functionality.

* [sentinel](http://godoc.org/github.com/mediocregopher/radix-extra/sentinel) -
  a client for [redis sentinel][sentinel] which acts as a connection pool for a
  cluster of redis nodes. A sentinel client connects to a sentinel instance and
  any master redis instances that instance is monitoring. If a master becomes
  unavailable, the sentinel client will automatically start distributing
  connections from the slave chosen by the sentinel instance.
